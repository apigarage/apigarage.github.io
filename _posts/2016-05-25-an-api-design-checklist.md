Getting started with API design can be challenging. Thereâ€™s plenty of information out there, but how do you boil it all down to an actionable set of design concerns?

We have taken all of our findings and used it to create this simple understandable and actionable checklist. You can use it to bootstrap your API project and get started with implementation much more quickly.
